# google.homepage
First project from the Odin Project! Incorporating knowledge of CSS and HTML
I want to be able to show off what I have learned from doing about a month's worth of learning for HTML and CSS.
Hopefully the lesseons I have learned from the Responsive Web Design course will be useful in this regard. I will be keeping a record of what caused me the most grief when figuring out how to make a basic example of the Google homepage.
    1. Layout
        a. Jesus christ, figuring how to get the logo and the search bar was a fucking headache. About 30 minutes wasted trying to see if margin: 0 auto; or sometime of position comamand would get it done. Who knew using display: flex would be my best friend - really love this because somehow learning how to use flexbox has always been quite challenging for me.
        b. Spacing
            OOF, spacing is also a trip. Somehow I get by with the grace of text-align and more flexbox!
    2. Buttons
        Kinda struggling with the buttons and how frustrating they can be. It is kinda hard to get them to the level that I want them to be.
Good luck me!
